          <h3>Major Problems</h3>
          <p>The digital landscape of Pakistan (a developing country) has three major issues:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Problem 1: Dependence on Foreign Technologies</h4>
              <p>Our tech ecosystem heavily relies on software and tools developed by other countries, limiting local innovation and reducing digital independence.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Problem 2: Uncritical Adoption Without Cultural Context</h4>
              <p>We often adopt foreign technologies and practices without assessing their societal impact or alignment with our cultural and Islamic values—risking unintended consequences.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Problem 3: Eroding Digital Sovereignty</h4>
              <p>This increasing reliance compromises our ability to build self-sustaining systems and may jeopardize the freedom and autonomy of future generations. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div class="solutions">
          <h3>Our Solutions</h3>
          <p>If Allah wills, We plan to take following three major steps to solve these problems:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Solution 1: Empowering Youth Through Purposeful Digital Awareness</h4>
              <p>Foster digital literacy among youth to inspire early, meaningful contributions to society—grounded in responsibility, ethics, and long-term impact.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Solution 2: Collaborative Open-Source Innovation for Local Needs</h4>
              <p>Bring together industry leaders, educators, technologists, and learners to co-create open-source solutions tailored for localized challenges and sustainable development.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Solution 3: Ethical and Critical Evaluation of Technology</h4>
              <p>Conduct in-depth studies and real-world experiments to assess technological impact, identify potential risks, and ensure alignment with Islamic values and societal wellbeing.</p>
